# Mentar curriculum template — Australia, Year 12 Chemistry.
# SENIOR SCIENCE IS A SPLIT SUBJECT. Junior years ship one combined "Science"
# pack because that is what a student studies; at senior level they enrol in
# Physics, Chemistry or Biology separately, so shipping a merged pack here would
# misrepresent the curriculum (maintainer decision 2026-08-15: "senior science
# needs to split... let's follow the curriculum").
# NO claimed alignment: senior science is set by state certificate authorities (VCE/HSC/QCE/SACE),
# not by one national content-description set (docs/CONTENT_LICENSES.md §2b).
# Content is universally-taught senior chemistry, 100% Mentar-authored.
# Items come from shared parametric generators (engine/senior_science_items.py),
# so the deterministic verifier scores every answer.

# Australia — Year 12 Chemistry (senior)

**No claimed alignment** to any certificate authority's units — these nodes are
universally-taught senior chemistry at roughly this level.

Node ids are prefixed `au12_`; the generators are shared across all three
countries' senior packs (`engine/senior_science_items.py` — one progression, keyed
by senior stage). The deterministic verifier scores every answer; the model never
decides correctness (SPEC §14).
